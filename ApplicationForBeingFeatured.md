
# Application for being Featured


## Requirements:

- Your list must be SFW without the need of paid content (exceptions are official DLCs)
- You must have a Discord account
- You must be able to provide basic support for your modlist (basic support means: installer support, bug fixing and at least a place for user to user gameplay help)
- Your readme has to be easy to understand from start to finish. At the top of your readme, you must provide a link to the Wabbajack installer and the support server of choice. As an example: [Ruvaak](https://github.com/chri3i/Ruvaak-Readme).
- If you want to use the Animonculory server as your support hub, please join the [server](https://discord.gg/DffHKcszfg) and ask about it in the dedicated channel. (#submission-help)
- If all of the above is reasonable to you, please fill out this [Form](https://dyno.gg/form/208fe5aa)
- If your application fulfills our requirements, you will be featured in an [Open Beta](https://github.com/The-Animonculory/The-Animonculory-Modlist-Hub/blob/main/FeaturedLists.md#beta) with a dedicated beta area on our website. The beta will be 3 weeks, in which we use user feedback and your responsiveness as a metric for being an official Animonculory list
